# Physical AI Smart Spaces Dataset

![Demo of MTMC_Tracking](./demo.gif)

## Overview
Comprehensive, annotated dataset for multi-camera tracking and 2D/3D object detection. This dataset is synthetically generated with Omniverse and Cosmos Transfer.

This dataset consists of over 280 hours of video from across nearly 1,800 cameras from indoor scenes in warehouses, hospitals, retail, and more. The dataset is time synchronized for tracking humans, forklifts, pallet trucks and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) across multiple cameras.

## Dataset Description

### Dataset Owner(s)
NVIDIA

### Dataset Creation Date
We started to create this dataset in December, 2023. First version was completed and released as part of 8th AI City Challenge in conjunction with CVPR 2024.

### Dataset Characterization
- Data Collection Method: Synthetic
- Labeling Method: Automatic with IsaacSim

### Video Format
- Video Standard: MP4 (H.264)
- Video Resolution: 1080p
- Video Frame rate: 30 FPS

### Ground Truth Format (MOTChallenge) for `MTMC_Tracking_2024`
Annotations are provided in the following text format per line:

```
<camera_id> <obj_id> <frame_id> <xmin> <ymin> <width> <height> <xworld> <yworld>
```

- `<camera_id>`: Numeric identifier for the camera.
- `<obj_id>`: Consistent numeric identifier for each object across cameras.
- `<frame_id>`: Frame index starting from 0.
- `<xmin> <ymin> <width> <height>`: Axis-aligned bounding box coordinates in pixels (top-left origin).
- `<xworld> <yworld>`: Global coordinates (projected bottom points of objects) based on provided camera matrices.

The video file and calibration (camera matrix and homography) are provided for each camera view.

Calibration and ground truth files in the updated 2025 JSON format are now also included for each scene. 

Notes:
- Some calibration fields—such as camera coordinates, camera directions, and scale factors—are not be available for the 2024 dataset due to original data limitations.
- Please be aware that the video identified as `scene_071/camera_0649` has encountered corruption issues. We advise you to exclude this video from your submissions.
- In the sequences ranging from scenes 071 to 080, you'll find a storage room distinct from the primary retail space. Although separate, individuals can access this area. We have ensured that these sequences are synchronized effectively, treating them as part of the same continuous space for analysis purposes.

### Directory Structure for `MTMC_Tracking_2025` and `MTMC_Tracking_2026`
- `videos/`: Video files.
- `depth_maps/`: Depth maps stored as PNG images and compressed within HDF5 files. These files are exceedingly large; you may choose to use RGB videos only if preferred.
- `ground_truth.json`: Detailed ground truth annotations (see below).
- `calibration.json`: Camera calibration and metadata.
- `map.png`: Visualization map in top-down view.

### Ground Truth Format (JSON) for `MTMC_Tracking_2025` and `MTMC_Tracking_2026`

```json
{
  "<frame_id>": [
    {
      "object_type": "<class_name>",

### Evaluation
- **2024 Edition**: Evaluation based on 3D-location-based HOTA scores at the [2024 AI City Challenge Server](https://eval.aicitychallenge.org/aicity2024). The submission is currently disabled, as the ground truths of test set are provided with this release.
- **2025 Edition**: Evaluation based on 3D-bounding-box-based HOTA scores at the [2025 AI City Challenge Server](https://eval.aicitychallenge.org/aicity2025).
- **2026 Edition**: Evaluation based on 3D-bounding-box-based HOTA scores at the 2026 AI City Challenge Server (link to be announced).
- **Evaluation script**: An offline HOTA evaluator that reproduces the official AICity MTMC (3D-bounding-box HOTA) metric is provided in the [`spatialai-data-utils` evaluation tools](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/tree/develop/libs/analytics/spatialai-data-utils/tools/evaluation) — see `evaluate_aicity_mtmc.py`.

## Changelog
- **2026-07-27**: Added complete [Croissant metadata](./croissant.json), including Responsible AI fields, and VGGT reprojection-error reports for the two real-world `MTMC_Tracking_2026` test scenes: [`Warehouse_026`](./MTMC_Tracking_2026/test/Warehouse_026/vggt_reprojection_error.txt) and [`Warehouse_027`](./MTMC_Tracking_2026/test/Warehouse_027/vggt_reprojection_error.txt).
- **2026-06-04**: Released 2 real-world test scenes for `MTMC_Tracking_2026` — `Warehouse_026` (4 cameras) and `Warehouse_027` (7 cameras), provided as 1080p / 30 FPS video covering the first 60 seconds (1800 frames) of each scene — the labeled evaluation window — with 2025-format `calibration.json`. An offline HOTA evaluator that reproduces the official AICity MTMC metric is available in the [`spatialai-data-utils` evaluation tools](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/tree/develop/libs/analytics/spatialai-data-utils/tools/evaluation) (`evaluate_aicity_mtmc.py`).
- **2026-05-15**: Released 3 synthetic test sets for `MTMC_Tracking_2026`. The remaining real-world test sets are scheduled for release at the end of May. The evaluation system for the 2026 AI City Challenge Track 1 has also been postponed to the end of May. In addition, the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 1 evaluation system has been temporarily disabled and will be re-opened after the conclusion of the 2026 AI City Challenge.
- **2026-04-29**: Initial release of `MTMC_Tracking_2026` — 26 scenes, 342 cameras, 28.5 camera-hours of 1080p video, 11.1M 3D boxes / 33.2M 2D boxes, with depth maps; calibration and GT aligned to the 2025 schema. 6 scenes (`Warehouse_001`, `_003`, `_005`, `_007`, `_021`, `_024`) are **Cosmos Transfer 2.5 (CT2.5) augmented** re-renderings of their source scenes (same scene/cameras/calibration/depth/GT, augmented RGB).
- **2025-07-14**: Provided evaluation tools for both 2024 and 2025 datasets.
- **2025-06-16**: Updated ground truth and calibration files, and removed misaligned videos and depth maps for train/val scenes in `MTMC_Tracking_2025`.
