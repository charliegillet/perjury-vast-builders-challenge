![VSS Warehouse Blueprint's 2D Vision AI with Agents Profile](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/_images/2D-analytics-blueprint-with-agents.png)

### Components and Interactions [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#components-and-interactions "Link to this heading")

The diagram depicts **VSS Warehouse 2D Vision AI with Agents Profile**, emphasizing 2D single-camera detection, tracking, and behavior analytics for safety events and metrics. Below is a breakdown of the components and their interactions.

01. **Input Source**

    - **Videos**: Raw video data stored in a filesystem, serving as input for processing.

    - **NvStreamer** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vios-nvstreamer.html)): A microservice that streams videos via RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) to the **VIOS (Video IO & Storage)**. NvStreamer can be swapped with real-world cameras.
02. **Video IO & Storage (VIOS)** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vios-microservices.html)):

    - VIOS ingests video streams from NvStreamer via RTSP.

    - It records the streams and forwards them (via RTSP) to the **DeepStream** microservice for further processing.
03. **DeepStream** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-single-camera-detection-and-tracking-RTDETR.html)):

    - DeepStream processes RTSP streams for 2D single-camera detection and tracking, utilizing the RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer) model ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/models/rt-detr.html)) to generate precise 2D bounding boxes for diverse objects including people, humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse equipment.

    - RT-DETR features a ResNet-50 backbone, pretrained on warehouse scene datasets for accurate 2D object detection in industrial environments.

    - It sends frame data, including detected and tracked object IDs, in Protobuf format to the **Kafka** messaging system via the `mdx-raw` topic.
04. **Kafka (Messaging System)** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/kafka.html)):

    - Kafka serves as the central hub for data distribution, using Protobuf for all data exchanges.

    - It also functions as a control bus, managing notifications (in JSON, via `mdx-notification`) for calibration updates, such as new ROI or tripwire definitions.
05. **Behavior Analytics** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/behavior-analytics.html)):

    - This microservice consumes `mdx-raw` data (Protobuf) from Kafka.

    - It processes the data to generate behavior analytics, safety insights, and metrics (ROI occupancy, tripwire crossings, proximity detections).

    - The resulting data, in Protobuf format, is sent back to Kafka (`mdx-behavior`, `mdx-events`, `mdx-incidents`) for indexing into Elasticsearch.

    - Candidate incidents (e.g., proximity violations) are forwarded to the Alerting Service for VLM-based verification.
06. **RTVI VLM (Real-Time Vision-Language Model)** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/real-time-vlm.html)):

    - A real-time inference microservice that processes video through a Vision-Language Model (VLM).

    - Chunks live RTSP streams or stored video clips into short segments and sends them to the VLM NIM for analysis.

    - Serves both the Alert Verification workflow (re-evaluating candidate events) and the Real-Time Alerts workflow (continuous always-on monitoring).
07. **Alerting Service** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/alerting-service.html)):

    - Operates in two modes:

      - **Alert Verification**: Consumes candidate events from Behavior Analytics (e.g., `proximity violation` on `mdx-incidents`), fetches the corresponding video clip from VIOS, sends it with a category-specific prompt to the VLM via RTVI VLM, and writes a verdict (`confirmed` / `rejected` / `unverified`) to Elasticsearch and Kafka.

      - **Real-Time Alerts**: Applies always-on rules (PPE, Load Quality, Pathway Obstruction, Spillover) to live RTSP streams via RTVI VLM, emitting an alert whenever the VLM classifies a chunk as a violation.
    - Alert type configurations are stored in Redis (RedisJSON) and can be updated at runtime.

    - For the full microservice reference, see [Alerts Microservice](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/alert-verification-service.html).
08. **LLM and VLM NIMs**:

    - **VLM NIM** (e.g., NVIDIA Cosmos3 Nano Reasoner): The vision-language model backend that powers alert verification, real-time alerts, and video understanding for the agent. Receives video frames plus prompts and returns structured predictions.

    - **LLM NIM** (e.g., NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 9B v2): The language model that powers the agent’s reasoning, query routing, and report generation.
09. **Storage**

    - **Redis** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/redis.html)): Stores alert type configurations (RedisJSON), sensor data router state, and serves as an optional message broker.

    - **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/elk.html)): Logstash retrieves raw frames, behavior, incidents, and VLM alert outputs from Kafka, converts Protobuf to JSON, stores the data in Elasticsearch, and supports querying and visualization.
10. **Visualization**

    - **Kibana UI** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html#kibana-ui-2d-blueprint)): A user interface for visualizing analytics data stored in Elasticsearch.

    - **VIOS UI** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html#vss-wh-2d-with-agents-vios-ui)): A separate interface for interacting with the VIOS system, receiving JSON notifications from Kafka.
11. **External Interfaces**

    - **Video Analytics API** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/video-analytics-api-server.html)): RESTful API providing programmatic access to analytics data, events, and incidents stored in Elasticsearch.

    - **Video Analytics MCP Server** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vss-orchestrator-mcp.html)): Exposes Elasticsearch queries, RTVI VLM controls, and alert management as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for the agent.
12. **Agents** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/agents.html)):

    - **VSS Agent**: An LLM-powered orchestration agent that interprets natural language queries, plans multi-step workflows, and invokes MCP tools. Capabilities include:

      - Querying warehouse safety incidents and occupancy data

      - Starting and stopping real-time VLM alert rules on specific cameras

      - Generating structured incident reports using VLM video analysis

      - Retrieving live camera snapshots and video clips
    - **Agentic Reference UI** ( [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/vss-warehouse-ui.html)): A browser-based interface with Chat, Alerts, and Dashboard modes for interacting with the agent system.

### Key Technologies [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#key-technologies "Link to this heading")

- **Microservices**: Components like NvStreamer, VIOS, DeepStream, Behavior Analytics, RTVI VLM, and the Alerting Service are modular, independently deployable microservices.

- **RTSP**: Facilitates real-time video streaming between cameras, NvStreamer, VIOS, and RTVI VLM.

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: NVIDIA Cosmos3 Nano Reasoner enables multi-step visual reasoning for alert verification, real-time anomaly detection, and video understanding.

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 9B v2 powers agent reasoning, query interpretation, and report generation.

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A standardized tool interface that exposes microservice capabilities (analytics queries, alert management, video storage) to the LLM-powered agent.

- **Protobuf**: Ensures efficient, compact data exchange across the CV pipeline.

- **Kafka**: Manages data distribution and control messaging across all microservices.

- **Redis**: Stores alert configurations (RedisJSON) and provides optional message streaming.

- **ELK Stack**: Supports storage, logging, and visualization of events, incidents, and alert verdicts.

- **JSON**: Used for notifications, calibration data, and VLM alert outputs.

## Events and Incidents [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#events-and-incidents "Link to this heading")

### Events [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#events "Link to this heading")

The 2D Vision AI with Agents Profile runs the same Behavior Analytics 2D pipeline as the 2D Vision AI Profile, processing live camera feeds, detecting and tracking objects, and generating events based on configurable logic.

Two types of events are supported:

- ROI Events: Triggered when objects enter or exit a predefined region of interest (ROI).

- Tripwire Events: Triggered when objects cross a predefined tripwire.


Each event type is associated with a specific logic and configuration. For more details, see [Event Detection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/behavior-analytics.html#ba-event-detection).

All event data is stored in Elasticsearch, and can be queried and visualized in Kibana, the VIOS UI, and through the agent.

### Incidents [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#incidents "Link to this heading")

In addition to instantaneous events, the profile detects violations in each enhanced frame and tracks them over time. When a violation persists beyond its configured threshold, it is promoted to a confirmed incident. The following incident types are generated:

- Proximity Violation: Objects come too close to each other (for example, a person near moving equipment).

- Restricted Area Violation: Objects enter a prohibited zone (ROI).

- Confined Area Violation: Objects leave a designated safe zone.


Incident timing (threshold and expiration window) is configurable per type. For the violation-to-incident framework, configuration parameters, and enhanced-frame data, see [Incident Generation](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/behavior-analytics.html#ba-incident-generation).

### Use Cases [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#use-cases "Link to this heading")

ROI events, tripwire events, and the proximity, restricted-area, and confined-area incidents provide the foundation for safety monitoring and operational intelligence in warehouse environments. With the agent, operators can query this data in natural language—surfacing ROI occupancy counts, tripwire crossings, recent violations, and incident histories—on top of the real-time situational awareness the 2D pipeline provides.

## Latency Measurements [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#latency-measurements "Link to this heading")

| Platform | #Streams | FPS | Interval | (NvStreamer + VIOS + DeepStream) latency | Behavior-analytics latency | Analytics E2E latency | RTVI-VLM latency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RTX 6000 PRO SE | 4 | 30 | 1 | 43 ms | 33 ms | 76 ms | 22.607s |

**Latency Measurements (p50)** [#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html#id1 "Link to this table")

Note

The measured latencies vary with several factors, each affecting a different stage of the pipeline:

- **(NvStreamer + VIOS + DeepStream / RTVI-CV) latency** is driven by the GPU hardware.

- **Behavior-analytics latency** scales mainly with the number of objects in a scene and the number of configured ROIs and tripwires.

- **Analytics E2E latency** is the sum of the above two latencies.

- **RTVI-VLM latency** grows with the number of enabled real-time alert rules and with each rule’s parameters; see [Real-Time Alerts](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/alerting-service.html#alerting-service-real-time-alerts) for configuration details.


## Customization [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#customization "Link to this heading")

The Blueprint supports several levels of customization:

- **Data Level**: Add, remove, or replace cameras while maintaining the existing workflow

- **Model Level**: Fine-tune perception models or integrate different LLM models to better suit your use cases

- **Application Level**: Build new microservices or applications using the provided APIs and components

- **Microservice Level**: Modify existing microservices from source code to extend functionality


### Adding New Cameras or Custom Datasets [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#adding-new-cameras-or-custom-datasets "Link to this heading")

Important

Recorded videos and live RTSP streams must be encoded without B-frames and have a resolution of `1920 x 1080`.

To check for and remove B-frames, see [the FAQ guidance](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/FAQ.html#faq-video-b-frames).

For custom video inputs, provide time-synchronized MP4 videos encoded without B-frames that are at least 60 seconds long and all videos should have the same duration.

AMC relies heavily on moving people in the input videos. Ensure that the videos contain a sufficient number of clearly visible moving people.

#### Step 1: Prepare video sources [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#step-1-prepare-video-sources "Link to this heading")

Choose one of the following options to provide video sources for the 2D profile with agents:

1. **Using recorded videos**

Use this option to run the VSS with local video files instead of live camera feeds. Place your videos in the `videos` directory under the path configured by `VSS_DATA_DIR` in `$VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/.env`.

2. **Using live RTSP streams**


> Use this option when you want to use live RTSP endpoints. Define each camera in `$VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/camera_configs/camera_info.json` so the VSS Configurator can read the camera list and generate the required configuration. The following steps apply when using live RTSP streams.
>
> 1. **Create a Sensor Info File** (`camera_info.json`):
>
>
> > ```
> > {
> >   "sensors": [\
> >     {\
> >       "camera_name": "camera-01",\
> >       "rtsp_url": "rtsp://<IP_address:port>/stream1"\
> >     },\
> >     {\
> >       "camera_name": "camera-02",\
> >       "rtsp_url": "rtsp://<IP_address:port>/stream1"\
> >     }\
> >   ]
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > Copy to clipboard
> >
> > The `camera_name` value should be unique for each camera, and `rtsp_url` should point to the camera stream.
> >
> > **Required fields:**`camera_name`, `rtsp_url`
> >
> > Note
> >
> > Each `rtsp_url` in `camera_info.json` must be reachable from the machine where you deploy VSS. VIOS connects to those URLs directly. Before you deploy, test every URL from the deployment machine (for example, with VLC or `ffplay`).
>
> 2. **Configure VSS Configurator environment variables**: Set the following in `$VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/.env`:
>
>
> > ```
> > SENSOR_INFO_SOURCE=file
> > SENSOR_FILE_PATH=<path_to_camera_info.json>
> > ```
> >
> > Copy to clipboard


#### Step 2: Configure number of streams [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#step-2-configure-number-of-streams "Link to this heading")

**Configuring Number of Streams**

Number of streams to be processed can be configured in two ways:

1. **Static Configuration**: Set the `NUM_STREAMS` environment variable to specify the desired number of streams for video dataset or RTSP streams.





```
NUM_STREAMS=4
```

Copy to clipboard



The configured number of streams should be less than or equal to the maximum streams supported by your hardware profile and deployment mode. VSS Configurator can be used to automatically cap the stream count using the formula: `final_stream_count = min(NUM_STREAMS, max_streams_supported)`. For more details, refer to the [How to Count Files Dynamically (Prerequisites)](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vss-configurator.html#how-to-count-files-dynamically-prerequisites) section in [VSS Configurator Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vss-configurator.html).

2. **Dynamic Configuration**: Use the VSS Configurator’s prerequisite operations to automatically count the number of video files in the recorded videos directory and use that count for configuration updates.



Note



Dynamic Configuration cannot be used for live RTSP streams.



**Example:** Automatically determine stream count from video files in the dataset directory:





```
# In blueprint_config.yml
commons:
     # Step 1: Count video files BEFORE variable processing
     prerequisites:
       2d:
      - operation_type: "file_management"
        target_directories:
          - "${VSS_DATA_DIR}/videos/warehouse-2d-app"
        file_management:
          action: "file_count"
          parameters:
            pattern: "*.mp4"
          output_variable: "available_video_count"  # Stores count (e.g., 6)

# Step 2: Use the count to compute final stream count
variables:
    2d:
      # Cap to minimum of: available videos, GPU limit
      - final_stream_count: "min(${available_video_count}, ${max_streams_supported})"

# Step 3: Use computed variable in config file updates
file_operations:
    2d:
      - operation_type: "text_config_update"
        target_file: "${DS_CONFIG_DIR}/ds-main-config.txt"
        updates:
          max-batch-size: ${final_stream_count}
          batch-size: ${final_stream_count}
```

Copy to clipboard

**How it works:** If your dataset directory has 6 video files and the GPU supports a maximum of 4 streams, the configurator computes: `final_stream_count = min(6, 4) = 4`. For more details, refer to the [How to Count Files Dynamically (Prerequisites)](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vss-configurator.html#how-to-count-files-dynamically-prerequisites) section in [VSS Configurator Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/vss-configurator.html).

When using a custom recorded-video dataset, `NUM_STREAMS` depends on the number of video files available in that dataset. Make sure `NUM_STREAMS` is less than or equal to the number of videos you want to process.

To use a custom dataset:

- Set `SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET` in `$VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/.env` to the name of your dataset.

- Place the video files in `$VSS_DATA_DIR/videos/$SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET/`.

- Add the image metadata, calibration, and floor map files under `$VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-2d-app/calibration/sample-data/${SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET}`. You can refer to sample datasets provided in the repository for the expected file structure and sample contents.


Note

Refer to [RT-DETR Real-Time Performance](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/models/rt-detr.html#models-rtdetr-realtime-perf) for more details on the max streams supported for a particular GPU. If GPU is not found in list, then increase the streams gradually to find the optimal number of streams that can be used

#### Step 3: Deploy and generate new calibration [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#step-3-deploy-and-generate-new-calibration "Link to this heading")

Before deploying the stack and generating a calibration, create the projects directory:

```
mkdir -p ${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects
```

Copy to clipboard

Note

Projects will be saved in `${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects`.

Change the ownership of the Auto Calibration data and projects directories to UID `1000` and GID `1000`:

```
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ${VSS_DATA_DIR}/auto-calib
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects
```

Copy to clipboard

Deploy the auto-calibration profile (`bp_wh_auto_calib_2d`) to generate a new calibration against live RTSP streams served by nvstreamer, using the warehouse dataset and VST stack. For steps to generate calibration, see [AutoMagicCalib quickstart](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/autocalib-getting-started.html#autocalib-quickstart-guide). Once the calibration is generated, store it, bring the Docker Compose stack down, and update the calibration file at `$VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-2d-app/calibration/sample-data/${SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET}/calibration.json`.

Note

- Maintain a single `calibration.json` file per deployment.

- Each sensor name in `calibration.json` must match the corresponding `camera_name` in `camera_info.json` or the name of the corresponding video placed in `${VSS_DATA_DIR}/videos`.

- For 2D profile use cases, ROIs and Tripwires are drawn for each camera view.

- The calibration file exported from the AMC UI may include `group` and `region` blocks under each entry in `sensors[]`. These are used only by the 3D and MV3DT profiles and are not needed by the 2D profile with Agents. Remove the `group` and `region` blocks from each sensor entry before importing the file.

- Add new camera information following the schema defined in [Calibration Schema](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/calibration-schema.html).

- The `imageMetadata` file needs to be generated manually.

- Manually add any other attributes that are missing from the generated calibration file but are required for your use case.

- Auto Calibration requires time-synchronized videos as input. For RTSP cameras, record videos from the RTSP source (e.g. using ffmpeg or similar tools), manually trim the videos to time-synchronize them if needed, then provide them to Auto Calibration.


#### Step 4: Redeploy the stack to apply the new calibration [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#step-4-redeploy-the-stack-to-apply-the-new-calibration "Link to this heading")

To redeploy the stack to apply the new calibration, follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/Quickstart-Guide.html#quickstart-guide-warehouse-blueprint).

Note

Before updating the warehouse `.env` file or running `docker compose up`, check whether containers from a previous Docker Compose deployment are still present:

```
docker ps -a
```

Copy to clipboard

No containers belonging to the previous deployment should be present before starting a new deployment. Stale containers from a previous deployment can cause silent errors. For example, already-running containers can create the false impression that a new deployment has started successfully.

### Model Customization [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#model-customization "Link to this heading")

#### Perception Model Fine-tuning [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#perception-model-fine-tuning "Link to this heading")

The Blueprint uses RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer) as its primary perception model. RT-DETR features a ResNet-50 backbone and is pretrained on warehouse scene datasets for precise 2D object detection in industrial environments. For details, see:
[2D Single Camera Detection and Tracking](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-single-camera-detection-and-tracking-RTDETR.html).

For fine-tuning the RT-DETR model via TAO Toolkit on custom datasets, refer to:
[RT-DETR (TAO fine-tuning)](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/models/rt-detr.html).

#### LLM Integration [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#llm-integration "Link to this heading")

Integrate different LLM services or locally deployed models in the agent.

### Application Customization [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#application-customization "Link to this heading")

The Blueprint uses a modular microservices architecture with the following communication channels:

- Kafka message broker

- Elasticsearch database

- REST APIs


Users can build their own microservices by consuming data from the above channels.

For complete API documentation, see [API Reference Page](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/API-Reference.html).

A deployed 2D Vision AI with Agents Profile can also be driven from a coding agent (Claude Code or Codex) using [Agent Skills](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/agent-skills.html#agent-skills). Skills such as `vss-deploy-profile`, `vss-deploy-detection-tracking-2d`, `vss-query-analytics`, `vss-setup-behavior-analytics`, and `vss-manage-video-io-storage` cover deployment, operation, and analytics queries against this profile through natural language.

#### Available Service Ports [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#available-service-ports "Link to this heading")

The following ports are used during deployment, and users can leverage them for any potential integration:

| Service | Port |
| --- | --- |
| Kafka | 9092 |
| Elasticsearch | 9200 |

For detailed information about customizing specific alert microservices, refer to:

- [Alerting Service](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/alerting-service.html) — alert use cases (Near Miss,
Load Quality, Pathway Obstruction, Spillover, PPE), Alert Bridge output
formats, and prompt-tuning workflow.

- RTVI VLM for [Alert Verification](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/alerting-service.html#alerting-service-alert-verification)
and [Real-Time Alerts](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/alerting-service.html#alerting-service-real-time-alerts) — the two
operating modes that drive RTVI VLM. _Alert Verification_ re-evaluates
upstream candidate events (`nv.Incident` / `nv.Behavior`) with
per-alert-type prompts in `alert_type_config.json`;
_Real-Time Alerts_ run continuous always-on rules from
`realtime-config.yml` against live RTSP streams.

- [Alert Bridge](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/alerting-service.html#alerting-service-alert-bridge) — supported VLM
response formats (Cosmos Reason, JSON, custom parsers) and verdict
vocabulary.


### Hardware Config Customization [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#hardware-config-customization "Link to this heading")

The 2D Warehouse Blueprint requires several configuration files to be properly tuned based on your GPU hardware and deployment requirements. When changing hardware (e.g., switching from H100 to L4 GPU) or adjusting the number of video streams, multiple configuration files must be updated to ensure optimal performance and prevent GPU overload.

#### Configuration Files Requiring Hardware-Based Updates [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#configuration-files-requiring-hardware-based-updates "Link to this heading")

The following table lists the configuration files that typically require updates when hardware changes:

| Configuration File | Parameters to Update | Why Update is Needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ds-main-config.txt` | `num-source-bins`, `max-batch-size`, `batch-size`, `msg-broker-config`, `msg-broker-conn-str`, `msg-broker-proto-lib` | Batch sizes must match stream count for optimal GPU utilization; message broker entries select between Kafka and Redis |
| `ds-kafka-config.txt` / `ds-redis-config.txt` | Broker connection settings | DeepStream message broker config selected based on `STREAM_TYPE` |
| `vst-config.json` (NvStreamer) | `nv_streamer_sync_file_count` | Sync file count must align with stream count |
| `vst_config.json` (VIOS) | `onvif.max_devices_supported`, `data.always_recording`, `notifications.use_message_broker_consumer` | Device limits must match GPU capacity; message broker consumer must match `STREAM_TYPE` |

There are two approaches to customize these configuration files:

#### Approach 1: Manual Configuration [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#approach-1-manual-configuration "Link to this heading")

Manually update all required configuration files before deploying the blueprint. This is time consuming, error prone and often not suitable for production deployments.

```
# Update DeepStream main config
vi <PATH_TO_DS_CONFIG_DIR>/ds-main-config.txt
# Set: num-source-bins=0, max-batch-size=<stream_count>, batch-size=<stream_count>
# Set msg-broker-config to ds-kafka-config.txt or ds-redis-config.txt depending on STREAM_TYPE

# Update DeepStream message broker config (Kafka or Redis variant, selected by STREAM_TYPE)
vi <PATH_TO_DS_CONFIG_DIR>/ds-kafka-config.txt    # for STREAM_TYPE=kafka
vi <PATH_TO_DS_CONFIG_DIR>/ds-redis-config.txt    # for STREAM_TYPE=redis

# Update NvStreamer config
vi <PATH_TO_NVSTREAMER_CONFIG_DIR>/vst-config.json
# Set: "nv_streamer_sync_file_count": <stream_count>

# Update VIOS (VST) config
vi <PATH_TO_VST_CONFIG_DIR>/vst_config.json
# Set: "onvif.max_devices_supported": <max_streams>, "data.always_recording": true,
#      "notifications.use_message_broker_consumer": "<STREAM_TYPE>"
```

#### Approach 2: Automatic Config Management using VSS Configurator [\#](https://docs.nvidia.com/vss/latest/warehouse-docs/2D-profile-with-agents.html\#approach-2-automatic-config-management-using-vss-configurator "Link to this heading")

The VSS Configurator provides a **declarative approach** to automatically update all required configuration files based on your hardware profile and deployment mode. This is the recommended approach for production deployments and simplifies the configuration management process.

To enable the VSS Configurator, in VSS Configurator’s environment variables you **must** set:

```
ENABLE_PROFILE_CONFIGURATOR=true
```

Copy to clipboard

By default, the VSS Configurator is disabled (`ENABLE_PROFILE_CONFIGURATOR=false`).
When enabled, it runs before the Blueprint Deployment starts and adjusts configuration files based on the hardware profile and deployment mode as defined in the HARDWARE\_PROFILE and MODE environment variables.

The VSS Configurator provides a comprehensive set of features for automated profile configuration management:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Configuration File Updates** | Automatically update configuration files in multiple formats:<br>- `yaml_update` \- Updates `.yaml`/`.yml` files while preserving structure. Supports nested keys via dot notation (e.g., `nested.config.value`)<br>  <br>- `json_update` \- Updates `.json` files with nested object support via dot notation (e.g., `data.stream_count`)<br>  <br>- `text_config_update` \- Updates `.txt`/`.conf`/`.cfg` files. Supports `key=value`, `key: value`, and `key value` formats<br>  <br>- `file_management` \- Manage files in directories (keep N files, remove extras) |
| **Environment Variable Validation** | Validate environment variables before deployment to catch configuration errors early:<br>- `allowed_values` \- Restrict to specific values (e.g., `["none", "local", "remote"]`)<br>  <br>- `allowed_patterns` \- Wildcard matching (e.g., `bp_wh_kafka*`)<br>  <br>- `disallowed_values` \- Block specific values<br>  <br>- `regex` \- Regular expression validation<br>  <br>- Conditional validation based on other variables |
| **Prerequisite Operations** | Run operations before variable processing to dynamically determine values:<br>- `file_count` \- Count files in a directory matching a pattern (e.g., count `*.mp4` files to determine available streams)<br>  <br>- Results stored as variables for use in subsequent calculations<br>  <br>- Useful for adapting configuration to actual data availability |
| **Variable Computations** | Create computed variables for intermediate calculations and condition checking. **Use case:** Automatically cap stream count to GPU limits using `final_stream_count: "min(${NUM_STREAMS}, ${max_streams_supported})"`, then reuse this value across all config files.<br>- Mathematical expressions: `min()`, `max()`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`<br>  <br>- Conditional expressions: `"4 if ${count} > 10 else 2"`<br>  <br>- Environment variable substitution: `${VAR_NAME}`<br>  <br>- **Value:** Define once, use everywhere - ensures consistency across multiple config files |

**Execution Order:** Prerequisite Operations → Environment Variable Validation → Variable Computations → Configuration File Updates
